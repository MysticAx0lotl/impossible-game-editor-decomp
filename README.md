This repository contains the decompiled (read: .jar ran through FernFlower) source code for The Impossible Game's level editor on PC

You will need Jetbrains IIntelliJ IDEA, as well as a JDK (I personally used [AdoptOpenJDK 12](https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html?variant=openjdk11&jvmVariant=hotspot)) to build. Clone the repo, download IDEA, and open it in there. 
The main class is located in src\com\grip\gui\TIGEditor.java, running it in IDEA will build and run the editor
